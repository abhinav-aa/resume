## About
I am a second year student at Farmingdale State College, studying Information Systems. I have always enjoyed working with computers, and applying them to solve problems. My first professional experience was working for my high school's IT department, where I gained real experience on troubleshooting computer systems. I am comfortable usjng C++, Python. Over winter break, I am working on getting Microsoft Certified in Azure Fundamentals, Power Platform and Dynamics.

I got involved in theatre in high school. I taught myself how to work with DMX lights and how to program on the ETC Ion board. I also learned how to work with sound equipment and tools. I learnt how to use QLAB for sound cues and set up wireless mics using software like WirelessWorkbench. During my time in high school, I ran lights for over 10 shows. I am currently learning to use Vectorworks to lighting draw plots.
